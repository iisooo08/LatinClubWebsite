  <h2 class="urbanist-title">Fates in Greek Mythology</h2>
  <p class="author-text">By Sieun Choi</p>
  <p class = "article-text">Fates, or “Moirai”, are the personification of inescapable destiny in Greek mythology. They are described as three stubborn, harsh, old women: Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. When a mortal is born, Clotho spins the thread of fate, Lachesis measures it, and then Atropos ends it, deciding death. These fates are above even the Olympian gods in mythology, which relates to their power and the undeniable, inescapable role of human destiny in Greek mythology. One example of this is the famous etymology of the Oedipus complex. The tale starts with the king of Thedos receiving an oracle about how his son, when born, will unalive his father and then marry his mother. The king tried to escape his fate by sending his son, Oedipus, off to a commoner couple in another town. However, the adoption only helped the oracle fulfill itself. After Oedipus hears it, still not knowing he’s adopted, he leaves the town and swears to never go back in fear of his fate. He unknowingly killed his biological father in a fight during the trip to Thedos, and for the reward of solving the riddle of the Sphinx, received the hand of the widowed queen, his mother. Her mother commits suicide after hearing the truth many years later, and this tragedy concludes how every action done to escape the fates was a step toward them. Another popular myth where the moirai had great influence was of the hero Achilles. The tale differs through how Achilles fully embraced his oracle and decided to continue serving in the Trojan War despite his fate of young death. Most Greek Mythology centers around similar heroes who, whether by chance or decision, tragically or gloriously, follow through with their given prophecy. This encapsulates a greater theme in how free will is how one will accept or make peace with their fate and not if they will since the choice is already made.
