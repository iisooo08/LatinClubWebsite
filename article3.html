  <h2 class="urbanist-title">The Influence of Greek Mythology on Western Literature</h2>
  <p class="author-text">By Yunjin Cho</p>
  <p class = "article-text">Greek literature has had a lasting impact on Western culture. The emotions, ideas, and characters present in the ancient stories are relevant to this day. The Iliad and Odyssey, written by the mysterious poet Homer, are examples of works that continued its legacy to modern writers. </p>

  <p class = "article-text">The Odyssey popularized story archetypes like the Hero’s Journey—a 12-step that includes a hero’s call to journey, an adventure to a different world, challenges, help from mentors, and return after the resolution. Such epics provided ways of storytelling and inspiration for Western authors. William Shakespeare, an English poet and playwright, often referenced Greek mythology in his works. </p>
<p class = "article-text">There are also series founded on myths that appeal to younger audiences, such as Percy Jackson & the Olympians by American actor Rick Riordarn. Character archetypes demonstrate how modern writers are influenced by Greek literature. Archetypes, derived from the Greek word “archetypos” (original pattern), represent a recurring personality or theme. Greek theatre and literature involved ones such as The Hero, The Tragic Hero, The Mentor, and The Nemesis.
