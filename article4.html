  <h2 class="urbanist-title">Greek vs. Roman Mythology: What's the Difference?</h2>
  <p class="author-text">By Yoomin (Rachel) Jung</p>
  <p class = "article-text">Greek and Roman mythology are often seen as interchangeable. And you might think: Why shouldn’t they be? After all, their pantheons share many traits: they both have a god for death, a god for the sea, a god for war, a goddess for harvest, and so on. Although the Romans adapted their beliefs from Greek mythology, there are differences due to the differences in geography and culture of the two civilizations.</p>

  <p class = "article-text">Take, for example, Poseidon and Neptune, the Greek and Roman gods of the sea. Poseidon was widely worshipped by the Greeks, with mythology showing that cities like Athens even competed to make him their patron god. On the other hand, Neptune was viewed as an unpredictable and destructive force rather than a protector.</p>
<p class = "article-text">Unsurprisingly, this difference can be traced back to geography. Greece had many islands and coastal cities, and the sea was essential for the flourishing of the civilization. Therefore, sailors and merchants relied on his favor for safe voyages. In contrast, Rome relied less on naval power and resources, focusing more on land-based conquest. Due to this difference in dependency for survival, Neptune never was as respected as Poseidon.
</p>
<p class = "article-text">A similar contrast is shown in the characterizations and domains of Ares and Mars, the Greek and Roman gods of war. In Greek mythology, Ares symbolized brutal and reckless warfare and was frequently despised by the other gods and feared by the mortals. In Roman mythology, on the other hand, Mars was greatly respected and honored as a representative of strategy, discipline, and Roman strength. He was also the mythical father of Romulus, or the founder of Rome, and was deeply tied to Rome's identity.
</p>
<p class = "article-text">The stark difference can be attributed to the general perception of warfare in each civilization. Greece was made of independent city-states and often had small, internal wars that were viewed as necessary evils rather than virtues, leading to Ares, the representation of it, being shunned. Rome, on the other hand, built its empire through military conquest across surrounding civilizations, and victory in war was a source of pride. This treatment of war as something honorable led to the reverence of Mars, the god of strategy and battle. </p>
