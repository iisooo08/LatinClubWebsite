  <h2 class="urbanist-title">Latin's Influence on Romance Languages</h2>
  <p class="author-text">By Jiwoo (Jasmine) Park</p>
  <p class = "article-text">Latin is the language of ancient Rome, and it has contributed significantly to the development of languages. It started modern as the language of a small community in the central part of Italy and expanded to the entire Roman Empire, becoming the language of administration, literature, law, and religion. Classical Latin, used in formal and literary language, existed alongside Vulgar Latin, the colloquial spoken Latin used by people.</p>
  <p class = "article-text">This language started to develop its regional dialects as the Roman Empire ceased to exist and communication between the territories decreased. These dialects became the Romance languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. Other factors that languages, contributed Germanic to and Moorish change invasions include; geographical location and their interaction influence with other regions. The above-mentioned languages are very similar in their structure as they are all derived from Latin and they have nominal and verbal categories. Nevertheless, each of them is rather unique. For instance, French has a phonetic evolution; however, Romanian has a closer relation with Latin in regards to grammar. It also reveals the Latin source in linguistic, historical, and cultural fields all around the world, even in the English language, which is derived from many Latin roots.</p>
